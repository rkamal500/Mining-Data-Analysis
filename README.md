# Mining-Data-Analysis
 ### Project Overview

- This project focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning for a mining dataset. The main objective is to prepare raw data for analysis by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and improving overall data quality.

 # Dataset

### Source: hh.csv

- Columns include mining case information, commodity details, geographic states, and timestamps.

- Unnecessary or redundant columns (FRMTN, CSE_NAME, SALE_DT, EXP_DT) were removed.

 # Methods Applied

### Data Cleaning

- Dropped irrelevant columns.

- Converted date columns (EFF_DT, Created, Modified) into datetime format.

- Filled missing values with appropriate statistical methods (mode/mean).

- Data Quality Improvement

- Ensured consistency in categorical variables.

- Treated missing and incorrect records.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.

- Generated summary statistics to understand dataset distribution.

# Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

# Future Work

- Perform advanced EDA with deeper insights.

- Automate data quality checks.
